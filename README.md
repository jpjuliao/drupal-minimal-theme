# Drupal Minimal Theme

A minimal Drupal theme using Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Single Directory Components (SDC).

## Drupal Version

Compatible with Drupal 8 and Drupal 9.

## Overview

The Drupal Minimal Theme is a lightweight theme designed to provide a clean starting point for Drupal projects. It leverages modern frontend technologies such as Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for enhanced JavaScript functionality, and Single Directory Components (SDC) for component-based development.

## Dependencies

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- Drupal: A free and open-source content management system for building websites and applications.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- npm: The package manager for JavaScript and Node.js.
- Storybook: An open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more.

## Usage

- Use the Drupal Minimal Theme as a starting point for custom Drupal themes.
- Develop and maintain your frontend components using Single Directory Components (SDC) for better organization and reusability.
- Customize the theme's styling by editing the assets/css/styles.css file and component-specific CSS files.
- Enhance JavaScript functionality by writing TypeScript code in the assets/ts directory and compiling it to JavaScript.
